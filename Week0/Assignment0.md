# Week 0: Python & NLP Fundamentals
##  Assignment0 Overview

This week focuses on building essential Python programming, data visualization, and Natural Language Processing (NLP) foundations. These skills are crucial for the upcoming legal document preprocessing and analysis tasks.

## 1. Python Fundamentals Assignment

**Notebook:** [Python Basics Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1B1WLjqWZPJZYR44IRrWIkqVOWkOKhO2a?usp=sharing)(Copy the assignment notebook, complete your code in it, save it as python_assignment.ipynb)

### Topics Covered:
- **Basic Python Syntax:** Variables, operators, and expressions
- **Data Structures:** Lists, dictionaries, tuples, and sets
- **Control Flow:** For/while loops, if-elif-else conditions
- **Functions:** Defining, calling, and using parameters
- **File Handling:** Reading/writing text files, CSV operations
- **Essential Libraries:** NumPy for numerical operations, Pandas for data manipulation
## 2. Matplotlib Visualization Assignment

**Notebook:** [Matplotlib Visualization Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1wCtERD2tR8Tfvi8iu6oGnK0cHt-QlomU?usp=sharing)(Same copy the notebook and make submission)

### Skills You'll Practice:
- **Basic Plot Types:** Line plots, bar charts, scatter plots
- **Plot Customization:** Titles, axis labels, legends
- **Layout Management:** Creating subplots and figure arrangements
- **Styling:** Color schemes, markers, line styles
- **Data Annotation:** Adding text and annotations to plots

## 3. Basic NLP Concepts (Short Notes or Mind Map)

### The NLP Pipeline for Legal Text Processing:

#### 1. **Sentence Segmentation**
#### 2. **Tokenization**
#### 3. **Stop-Words Removal**
#### 4. **Lemmatization**
#### 5. **Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging**
#### 6. **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**
#### Provide a detailed explanation of these topics, emphasizing their relevance and application in legal text preprocessing.
### Submit your response as either a document or a LaTeX file, depending on which format you are more comfortable with .



##  Submission Instructions for uploading files in Github:
#### Step 1: **Fork the Repository**
1. Go to the main project repository on GitHub
2. Click the **"Fork"** button in the top-right corner

#### Step 2: **Setup GitHub Desktop**
1. Download and install [GitHub Desktop](https://central.github.com/deployments/desktop/desktop/latest/win32)
2. Sign in with your GitHub credentials

#### Step 3: **Clone the Repository**
1. In GitHub Desktop, click **"File" → "Clone Repository"**
2. Select your forked repository from the list
3. Choose a local folder on your computer
4. Click **"Clone"**

#### Step 4: **Organize Your Work**

1. **Navigate to your local repository folder**
   - Open File Explorer (Windows) or Finder (Mac)
   - Go to the location where you cloned the repository in Step 3

2. **Create your submission folder**
   - Inside your local repository folder, create a **new folder** with this naming format:
     ```
     week0_rollno_yourname
     ```
     **Important:** Replace "yourname" with your actual name 
     
     **Examples:**
      - `week0_rollno_priya_sharma`

3. **Add your completed work to the folder**
   - Copy or save these files into your `week0_rollno_yourname` folder:
     - Completed Python notebook (.ipynb file)
     - Completed Matplotlib notebook (.ipynb file)
     - NLP concepts notes (as .md, .pdf, .docx)

4. **Place your folder in the correct location**
   - Go to your local repository folder
   - Find the existing `week0` folder (this is provided in the main repository structure)
   - **Drag your `week0_rollno_yourname` folder and drop it inside the `week0` folder**
